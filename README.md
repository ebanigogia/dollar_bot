## :rocket: Installation

The below instructions can be followed in order to set-up this bot at your end in a span of few minutes! Let's get started:

## 1. Clone the repository
1. Clone the Github repository to a desired location on your computer. You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/) to be preinstalled on your machine. Once the repository is cloned, you will then `cd` into the local repository.
   
2. Start a terminal session in the directory where the project has been cloned. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## 2. Install the Telegram desktop application
Make sure that you have Telegram desktop application installed in your system. You can download and install the Telegram desktop application from the following website.
 ```
 https://desktop.telegram.org/
 ```
## 3. Run the application

1. In Telegram, search for "BotFather". Click on "Start", and enter the following command:
```
  /newbot
```
2. Follow the instructions on screen and choose a name for your bot (e.g., `dollarbot`). After this, select a username for your bot that ends with "bot". The username has to be unique. 

3. The BotFather will now confirm the creation of your bot and provide a TOKEN to access the HTTP API - copy and save this token for future use.

4. In the repo directory (where you cloned it), run these commands to (i) grant execution access to a bash script, and (ii) execute that bash script to run the Telegram Bot:
```
   chmod a+x run.sh
   ./run.sh
```
   
(OR)
```
   chmod a+x run.sh
   bash run.sh
```
```Note```: It will ask you to paste the API token you received from Telegram in step 4.
A successful run will generate a message on your terminal that says "TeleBot: Started polling." 

5. In the Telegram app, search for your newly created bot by entering the username and open the same. Now, on Telegram, enter the "/start" or "menu" command, and you are all set to track your expenses!

### Run Automatically at Startup

To run the script automatically at startup / reboot, simply add the `.run_forever.sh` script to your `.bashrc` file, which executes whenever you reboot your system.

## :computer: Testing

We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:
```
python run -m pytest test/
```
<p align="center"><img width="500" src="./assets/TestCases.png"></p>


## :rocket: Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```
